        <h2 style="background-color: #FF9F1C;">What Computing Champions Does for You?</h2>
        <p style="background-color: #FF9F1C;">Computing Champions was set up in 2021 to aid primary school teachers during the Coronavirus pandemic and beyond. Through research we found that even during the pandemic teachers felt that their students still were lacking in the technical department and only being taught computing 1-2 times a week. We want to change that!</p>
        <p style="background-color: #FF9F1C;">Computing Champions is for teachers to help them educate and inspire students in the digital world. We help teachers across the UK to deliver the computing curriculum by using our: online guides, lesson plans, and resources for both KS1 and 2. For teachers who need to gain more knowledge themselves, we even offer free CPD.</p>
